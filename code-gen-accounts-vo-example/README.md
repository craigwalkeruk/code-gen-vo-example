This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Prompt used
I am designing a simple, responsive, mobile-first web application for a banking app, focusing on accounts and transactions views. I’m aiming for a clean and modern user experience (UX) tailored for young professionals, similar to a neo-European bank's approach. The app should follow these key requirements:

Mobile-first / Responsive Design: The app should be optimized for mobile use, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes smoothly. Design System: Utilize a modern design system (e.g., Material Design or Bootstrap) that supports consistency and reusability throughout the app. Accessibility: Follow WCAG standards for accessibility, ensuring the app is usable by all, including those with disabilities. Ease of Use: The UX should be intuitive, sleek, and minimal, catering to young professionals. The app should feel modern and straightforward, minimizing friction during navigation. UX Flow: Accounts Summary Screen: This screen should display a concise overview of all accounts, showing balances and recent activity. Transactions Screen: When a user clicks on an account, they should be taken to a detailed transaction view specific to that account. Include a simple, clear navigation option to return to the accounts summary. Code Standards: Adhere to Google’s best practices for code linting, ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Secure Code: Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities such as XSS, input validation errors, and other common security risks. I'd like your help in defining the layout and interaction flow for both the accounts and transactions screens, ensuring they are easy to navigate and visually engaging for the target audience.
